# Pan-context single-Cell (PanCell-eQTL) Atlas

This repository contains the full computational pipeline and analysis code for the manuscript "Single-cell eQTL mapping in multiple tissues and ancestries by repurposing public single-cell transcriptomes from 5,828 individuals."

Our work provides a foundational resource that substantially expands the resolution and diversity of human genetic regulation maps for dissecting disease and advancing precision medicine.

This repository is organized into folders containing scripts for each stage of the analysis, from data processing to figure generation.
